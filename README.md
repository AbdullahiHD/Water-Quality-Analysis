# 💧 Water Quality Analysis

This project aims to predict water potability using machine learning. The dataset contains physicochemical properties of water samples, which are used to classify whether the water is **safe (potable)** or **unsafe (non-potable)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Water Quality and Potability from Kaggle
- **Goal:** Predict whether water is potable based on pH, hardness, solids, conductivity, and other features.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahiHD/water-quality-analysis.git
cd water-quality-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🛠 Usage
jupyter notebook


## 📊 Results
The model evaluates water potability based on key chemical properties and classifies samples as safe or unsafe for drinking.
