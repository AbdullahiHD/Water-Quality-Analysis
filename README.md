# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Analysis

This project aims to predict water potability using machine learning. The dataset contains physicochemical properties of water samples, which are used to classify whether the water is **safe (potable)** or **unsafe (non-potable)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Water Quality and Potability from Kaggle
- **Goal:** Predict whether water is potable based on pH, hardness, solids, conductivity, and other features.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
